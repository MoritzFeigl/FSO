# FSO

This R package contains functions necessary to apply the Function Space Optimization for estimating parameter transfer functions (TFs) for distributed hydrological models. So far it is still incomplete and mainly includes functions to create, sample and prepare TFs as a basis for any FSO application.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of FSO from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MoritzFeigl/FSO")
```

# FSO

This R package contains functions necessary to apply the Function Space
Optimization for estimating parameter transfer functions (TFs) for
distributed hydrological models. So far it is still incomplete and
mainly includes functions to create, sample and prepare TFs as a basis
for any FSO application.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of FSO from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MoritzFeigl/FSO")
```
